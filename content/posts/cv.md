I hesitated for a while about making this page. 
Many people including me dislike long pages of text. However, there are occasions where they are needed. 
Who knows, there could be people who actually like to process this information like that. 
Personally, I believe a face-to-face meeting serves as the best CV of mine. 
If you are like me, contact me using the contact in the end of this post! Otherwise, have fun skimming through my career life (till now) ;).

*I certainly will update this page till I find a better way to log this kind of information.*
