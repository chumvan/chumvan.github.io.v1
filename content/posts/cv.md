I hesitated for a while about making this page. 
Many people including me dislike long pages of text. However, there are occasions where they are needed. 
Who knows, there could be people who actually like to process this information like that. 
Personally, I believe a face-to-face meeting serves as the best CV of mine. 
If you are like me, contact me using the contact in the end of this post! Otherwise, have fun skimming through my career life (till now) ;).

*I certainly will update this page till I find a better way to log this kind of information.*

# Experience
This is a short list of the position I have been (gratefully) working in for the last few years. 
For longer descriptions, click on any link you can find.

## Ericsson Finland
*IoT research team*

As a Research trainee and then a full-time Researcher, I worked on
- IoT Streaming research | one patent submitted
- Scientific documentation and presentation
- Signaling & Data Transferring System prototyping

## Tampere Universities
[*Audio Lab*](https://webpages.tuni.fi/arg/)

As a Research Assistant, I worked for the following tasks
- Preliminary tasks for the audio source localization project
- Data collection and labeling
- Scientific experiment design

*[FAST lab](https://www.tuni.fi/en/research/fast-lab) - [CHARM EU Project](https://charm-ecsel.eu/)*

As a core developer and a Research Assistant, I contributed to the following tasks:
- Apply and test the performance of the IoT framework for industrial cases:
    - **Sandvik**: Telemetry monitoring for the mining environment
    - **Valmet**: Paper roll machine condition monitoring
- Data management solution investigation and deployment

## Aalto University
*REMOS TUTLI Project & REMOS start-up*

First as a Research Assistant in the research and then the only IT engineer in the start-up, I contributed in:
- Designed a bright bolt to gather, process, and report stress data applied for deep mines in soft real-time.
- Deployed a time-series system for storage, processing, visualization, and evaluate strain data.
- Deploy and test performance for 20 devices in a network with Zigbee as the communication protocol in constraint conditions.
Key learning: applied machine learning, software development, system design, networking, electronic design, innovation, and business development 

## Tentrio Company
As an IoT developer and also a thesis worker achieved some learning as following:
- Investigated, designed, and implemented a device to measure and visualize an animal’s heart rate on web-app
- Result: A small system to measure big animal heart-rate including
    - portable custom stethoscope + filter circuit
    - the aggregate and pre-processing device from Arduino
    - web app to visualize ECG of animals with low latency and D3 plotting GUI
Key learning: Signal processing, web, visualization, circuit design

## Danang Heineken Brewery Factory
As an Automation engineer, I worked (in a completely sober state) with beer and beer making processes:
- Maintenance-trouble shooting Can & Bottle Automation Lines
- Responsible for Analyze-review process automation including PLC | HMI programs | test software-hardware.
